To use the Micronaut's integration with https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway] you must have the `micronaut-flyway`
dependency on your classpath:

dependency:micronaut-flyway[groupId="io.micronaut.flyway"]

In addition to the base Flyway dependency that will be included automatically with the above, some databases require an additional database-specific Flyway library. Include one of the following dependencies as needed for your database:

dependency:flyway-mysql[groupId="org.flywaydb", gradleScope="runtimeOnly"]

dependency:flyway-database-oracle[groupId="org.flywaydb", gradleScope="runtimeOnly"]

dependency:flyway-database-postgresql[groupId="org.flywaydb", gradleScope="runtimeOnly"]

dependency:flyway-sqlserver[groupId="org.flywaydb", gradleScope="runtimeOnly"]

You also need dependencies for the JDBC connection pool and the JDBC driver specific to your database as described in https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-sql/latest/guide/#jdbc[Configuring a JDBC DataSource].
