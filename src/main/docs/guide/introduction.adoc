To use the Micronaut's integration with https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway] you must have the `micronaut-flyway`
dependency on your classpath:

dependency:micronaut-flyway[groupId="io.micronaut.flyway"]

You also need dependencies for the JDBC connection pool and the JDBC driver as described in https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-sql/latest/guide/#jdbc[Configuring a JDBC DataSource].
